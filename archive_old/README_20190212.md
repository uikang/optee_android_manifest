# AOSP+OP-TEE manifest

This repository contains scripts that can be used to build an AOSP
build that includes OP-TEE for the hikey board. The build is based
on the latest OP-TEE release and updated every quarter.

## 1. References

* [AOSP Hikey build instructions][1]

## 2. Prerequisites

* Should already be able to build AOSP.  Distro should have necessary
  packages installed, and the repo tool should be installed.  Note
  that AOSP needs to be built with Java.  Also make sure that
  the `mtools` package is installed, which is needed to make the hikey
  boot image.

* In addition, you will need the pre-requisites necessary to build
  optee-os.

  After following the AOSP setup instructions, the following
  additional packages are needed.

```
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot autoconf \
	automake bc bison build-essential cscope curl device-tree-compiler flex \
	ftp-upload gdisk iasl libattr1-dev libc6:i386 libcap-dev libfdt-dev \
	libftdi-dev libglib2.0-dev libhidapi-dev libncurses5-dev \
	libpixman-1-dev libssl-dev libstdc++6:i386 libtool libz1:i386 make \
	mtools netcat python-crypto python-serial python-wand unzip uuid-dev \
	xdg-utils xterm xz-utils zlib1g-dev python-mako openjdk-8-jdk \
	ncurses-dev realpath android-tools-fsutils dosfstools libxml2-utils
```

## 3. Build steps

```
git clone https://github.com/linaro-swg/optee_android_manifest -b hikey-optee-exp-dev 
cd optee_android_manifest

# for HiKey620
./wrappers/sync-p.sh
./wrappers/build-p.sh #or `./build.sh -v p -4g` for a 4GB board!

# for HiKey960
./wrappers/sync-p-hikey960.sh
./wrappers/build-p-hikey960.sh

# Please make sure there are no errors before flashing!
```

**WARNNING:** `--force-sync` is used which means you might **lose your
work** so save often, save frequent, and save accordingly, especially
before running `sync-p.sh` again!

**EXTREME WARNING:** Do **NOT** use `git clean` with `-x` or `-X` or
`-e` option in `optee_android_manifest/`, else risk **losing all
files** in the directory!!!

**NOTE:** You can add the `-squashfs` option to `build.sh` to make
`system.img` size smaller, but this will make `/system` read-only, so
you won't be able to push files to it.

For older releases (other versions of relatively stable builds), use
below instead of `./sync-p.sh`.

```
./wrappers/sync.sh -v p -t <hikey|hikey960> -bm <name of a pinned manifest file in archive/> 2>&1 |tee logs/sync-p.log

# e.g.
./wrappers/sync.sh -v p -t hikey -bm pinned-manifest-stable_yvr18.xml 2>&1 |tee logs/sync-p.log
```

Other existing files are for internal development purposes ONLY and
**NOT SUPPORTED**!

## 4. Flashing the image

The instructions for flashing the image can be found in detail under
`device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey{960}/README` in the tree.
1. Set jumpers/switches 1-2 and 3-4, and unset 5-6.
2. Reset the board. After that, invoke:

```
# for HiKey620
cp -a out/target/product/hikey/*.img device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/
sudo ./device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey/flash-all.sh /dev/ttyUSBn

# for HiKey960
cp -a out/target/product/hikey960/*.img device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey960/
sudo ./device/linaro/hikey/installer/hikey960/flash-all.sh /dev/ttyUSBn
```

where the `ttyUSBn` device is the one that appears after rebooting with
the 3-4 jumper installed.  Note that the device only remains in this
recovery mode for about 90 seconds.  If you take too long to run the
flash commands, it will need to be reset again.

## 5. Partial flashing

The last handful of lines in the `flash-all.sh` script flash various
images.  After modifying and rebuilding Android, it is only necessary
to flash *boot*, *system*, *cache*, *vendor* and *userdata*. If you
aren't modifying the kernel, *boot* is not necessary, either.

## 6. Experimental Prebuilts

Available at http://snapshots.linaro.org/android under `android-hikey*`
directories.

## 7. Running xtest

Do NOT try to run `tee-supplicant` as it has already been started
automatically as a service! Once booted to the command prompt, `xtest`
can be run immediately from the command prompt.

## 8. Running VTS Gtest unit for Gatekeeper and Keymaster (Optional)
```
su system
./data/nativetest64/VtsHalGatekeeperV1_0TargetTest/VtsHalGatekeeperV1_0TargetTest
./data/nativetest64/VtsHalKeymasterV3_0TargetTest/VtsHalKeymasterV3_0TargetTest
```

**NOTE:** These tests need to be run as the `system` user.

## 9. Enable adb over usb

Boot the device. On serial console:

```
su setprop sys.usb.configfs 1
stop adbd
start adbd
```

## 10. Known issues

Adb over usb currently doesn't work on HiKey960. As a workaround, use
adb over tcpip. See https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502 for
details on how to connect. There are still some limitations however.
E.g. running `adb shell` or a second `adb` instance will break the
current adb tcpip connection. This might be due to unstable wifi
(there are periodic error messages like `wlcore: WARNING corrupted
packet in RX: status: 0x1 len: 76`) or just incompleteness of the
generic HiKey960 builds under P.
